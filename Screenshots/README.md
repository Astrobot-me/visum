# Project Visum
> Accident Prevention System caused By Drowsiness Driving  
<br>

### Project Brief
> **Utilise Sensors and AI Algorithms**: The system employs sensors and algorithms to analyse parameters like eye movement and facial expressions.

> **Real-Time Assessment**: By constantly assessing these factors like EAR & Facial Expression the system can accurately determine a driver's alertness level.

> **Warning and Intervention**: When fatigue signs are detected and crosses certain limits, the system issues warnings or takes intervention measures.

>**Microcontroller and OpenCV**: A microcontroller based independent unit processes the data, and Singles , a library for real-time computer vision & ML Model is used.

> **MediaPipe for Facial Landmark Detection**: MediaPipe, an open-source library by Google, is utilised for facial landmark detection to Calculate Eye Aspect Ratio.

> **Eye Aspect Ratio Calculation**: MediaPipe allows for the calculation of the eye aspect ratio, a critical factor in assessing fatigue.
